# Vibe to Production — the anti-MVP spec pipeline

This is a **Constraint-First Specification Architecture (CFSA)** pipeline. It turns a raw idea into exhaustively specified, test-driven, production-quality code through a series of progressive gates. Stack-agnostic. Agent-agnostic. Cross-platform. Every line of code, every spec, every test is production-grade from the moment it's written. Phases control scope, never quality. There is no "fix it later."

### Entry Point

Start the pipeline with:

```
/ideate                              # From scratch — deep interview
/ideate @path/to/your-idea.md        # From existing document
```

The `@file` pattern works with any pipeline command. The workflow reads the referenced file and detects the input type automatically.

### Progressive Decision Lock

Decisions in this pipeline are **progressively locked**. Each pipeline stage builds on the locked decisions of previous stages:

1. `/ideate` locks the **vision** — problem, personas, features, constraints
2. `/create-prd` locks the **architecture** — tech stack, system design, security model
3. `/decompose-architecture` locks the **domain boundaries** — shard structure, dependencies
4. `/write-architecture-spec` locks the **interaction specs** — per-shard contracts, data models
5. `/write-be-spec` locks the **backend contracts** — API endpoints, schemas, middleware
6. `/write-fe-spec` locks the **frontend specs** — components, state, interactions
7. `/plan-phase` locks the **implementation order** — dependency-ordered TDD slices
7.5. `/verify-infrastructure` locks the **operational foundation** — CI/CD green, staging live, migrations clean, auth working
8. `/implement-slice` locks the **code** — tests → implementation → validation

Once a stage is locked, downstream stages may not contradict it. To change a locked decision, re-run the originating stage and cascade changes downstream.

> **Note**: Rows marked with ↳ are independently-invocable sub-workflows (shards)
> of their parent command. The parent orchestrates them in sequence, but each shard
> can also be run standalone with its own prerequisites. `/bootstrap-agents` is also
> sharded into `/bootstrap-agents-fill` and `/bootstrap-agents-provision`.
> `/resolve-ambiguity` is a utility command callable from any stage — it is not a sequential pipeline step.

> [!WARNING]
> If `docs/plans/vision.md` does not exist, the pipeline has not started — run `/ideate` before any other workflow.

> [!WARNING]
> If `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values appear anywhere in this file, bootstrap has not run — do not attempt implementation work.

### Installed Skills

{{INSTALLED_SKILLS}}

### Key Principles

1. **Production-grade always** — No throwaway code, no shortcuts, no tech debt by design
2. **Constraints before decisions** — Map what's already decided before presenting options
3. **Contract-first** — Zod schema → failing test → implementation (never reverse)
4. **TDD: failing test before code** — Red → Green → Refactor, every slice, every surface
5. **Security-first** — PII never leaks, inputs validated, secrets server-side only
